Find appropriate location for Javadocs
Create reporter factory for test set too
New crunch to create more unit tests
Bug: Fix debug rows seem to be line-broken in HTML report
plus/minus sign (or other indicator) as indication icon for expandable sections of html log

Check for similar errors in summary
Document that known errors only work on text testCaseLog phrases
Formatting of HTML styles - make reports pretty
Document more examples
Support for radiobuttons
Support for dropdown
Overriding settings from command prompt
Split solution in stand-alone framework component and SUT related stuff
Email report
Saving desktop image upon error, and not just browser content

Only displaying the most relevant testCaseLog rows in summary report
Add links to text testCaseLog from html testCaseLog
Implement support for parallel execution

Done
===========
Get rid of java 1.5 warnings
Implement toggleable sections for components in HTML test case log
Saving of html body upon error
Merge CliTestRunner and DiagnosticRun classes and choose by run time parameters
Move runSettings.properties file to better location
More REST service calls - put, delete
Minimum table width in html log
Test case data
Abstraction for GUI elements
Component support for test case testCaseLog (from callstack?)
REST service support
Remove ugly dependencies between Settings class and LogFolder class (and TestRun class?)
Support for known errors on TestSet
Support for known errors on TestCase
Support for known errors in reporting
Unit tests for framework

Summary report
Error grouping if several test cases has the same error
Summary report should take more than one test at the time...
WebDriver should not be where it is
Check for duplicate test cases registered for known error
Add links to detailed reports from summary report
Compile auto-documentation
BUG: Summary reports known errors multiple times
Screenshot name derived from test case name rather than not
BUG: Known errors don't work at all times (with both known and new errors it get misreported)
Create Diagnostics tool
Make sure known errors that are not encountered are listed in summary report
BUG: Test case name should not be 'invoked'
Test name from callstack
Make regex work for known errors
TestSet name in TestCase should be set correctly with ease (reflection)
Check in to git
Asses new runner that treats Assume better
Clean out un-used code parts
Make sure the known error documentation for TestSet is correct
