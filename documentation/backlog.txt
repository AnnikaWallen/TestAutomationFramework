Document how to use tests in Jenkins with this framework
Document that known errors only work on pure text testCaseLog phrases
Formatting of HTML styles - make reports pretty: For example, change colors of green stuff
Document more examples, and update existing with imports
Document required email settings
Append adjusted version of existing report plugin for ALM to framework
Append existing Personnummergenerator in framework
Append existing date calculator to framework
Support for radiobuttons and checkboxes
Support for dropdown
Saving desktop image upon error, and not just browser content
WebDriver toString() should be Overridden for relevant printouts
Assess using list of LogPost class even for summary report
Enable Multi-browser support
Implement support for only displaying the most relevant testCaseLog rows for failed test cases in summary report (not all failed log rows)
Add hyperlink to pure text based testCaseLog in html testCaseLog
Try making the object factories work from outside code base (by using settings)
Try making the plugins work from outside the code base (by using jar files in file directory)
Implement support for parallel execution

Done
===========
Bug: Progress bar in summary report behaves badly
Get rid of java 1.5 warnings
Implement support for web tables
Get ObjectFactory for Logger to ready state
Split solution in stand-alone framework component and SUT related stuff
Get scripts for release management working
Bug: Sometimes TestCaseHtmlLog get wrong status of test case. Known errors found, but still got status ONLY_NEW_ERRORS
Merge maven pom.xml files to make runnable jar, minimum jar, javadocs, dependencies and so forth
Email report
Create reporter factory for test set too
Implement toggleable sections for components in HTML test case log
Saving of html body upon error
Overriding settings from command prompt
Merge CliTestRunner and DiagnosticRun classes and choose by run time parameters
Move runSettings.properties file to better location
More REST service calls - put, delete
Minimum table width in html log
Test case data
Document new TestRunReportFactory
Abstraction for GUI elements
Component support for test case testCaseLog (from callstack?)
REST service support
Remove ugly dependencies between Settings class and LogFolder class (and TestRun class?)
Support for known errors on TestSet
Support for known errors on TestCase
Support for known errors in reporting
Unit tests for framework
Automatic data formatting in html testCaseLog
Screenshot better represented in html testCaseLog
Both HTML and text testCaseLog
Support for comparing similar LogPosts
Summary report
Error grouping if several test cases has the same error
Summary report should take more than one test at the time...
WebDriver should not be where it is
Check for duplicate test cases registered for known error
Add links to detailed reports from summary report
Compile auto-documentation
BUG: Summary reports known errors multiple times
Screenshot name derived from test case name rather than not
BUG: Known errors don't work at all times (with both known and new errors it get misreported)
Create Diagnostics tool
Make sure known errors that are not encountered are listed in summary report
BUG: Test case name should not be 'invoked'
Test name from callstack
Make regex work for known errors
TestSet name in TestCase should be set correctly with ease (reflection)
Check in to git
Asses new runner that treats Assume better
Clean out un-used code parts
Make sure the known error documentation for TestSet is correct
