Release notes for TAF
==========================

Added to version v1.0.14
-------------------------
* Support for checking the links on the page you are at for broken links. Links that don't return HTTP status code 200 are treated as failed verifications.
* Test case result evaluation now present test case status easily in stdOut to ease assessment in debugging with cheezy ASCII face emoticons (also being logged).
* Added release notes to project files (this file).

Added to version v1.0.13
-------------------------
* New web table verification for dynamically populated tables, that retries verification continuously until timeout, for dynamically rendered table rows to appear.
* Re-made method of verifying web element text to enable verification of dynamically rendered texts that appear after a while.

Added to version v1.0.12
-------------------------
* New web text verification that give time for the element to render. Previous version only gave time for element to appear. If it appeared but was populated with text later the verification failed. Now this is fixed.
* Verification possibilities for stuff in SQL databases, through JDBC calls, for low level tests and for test data manipulation.

Added to version v1.0.9
-------------------------
* Added support for RemoteWebDriver to enable remote execution of scripts, and enable a BrowserStack interface to be able to run tests on BrowserStack infrastructure (http://www.browserstack.com).

Added to versoin v1.0.8
-------------------------
* REST support refactored. REST response is more versatile, and HTTP headers are now customizable. This change was implemented for the REST support to be useful when security architectures need header manipulation.
* Customizable logo in HTML reports (both test case reports and test run reports) are back, and managed through TestRun.settings.setValue() or the runSettings.properties file. This is done to make users feel at home with the reports.
* Reports prettified and clarified a bit to be more appealing.

Added to version v1.0.7
-------------------------

-------------------------
* Code cleaning to ease understanding of code and to enable more people to participate in development of this framework.

Added to version v1.0.4
-------------------------
* Web tables implemented with the feature rich TableData class for better logging and verification possibilities - and neater outputs from verifications.

Added to version v1.0.3
